                  o7 everyone, and hello Commanders.
                  <br>It is my great honor to formally welcome you all to the Landstrider Legion.
                  <br>We hope to provide some clarification and updates with regard to the status of the squadron.
                  <br>As some of you are aware, the Landstrider Legion is a squadron established in response to the Legion’s leadership divesting ourselves from our previous organization, the Rook Platoon, due to leadership and playstyle differences. 
                  <br>Despite our split, it is the stance of the Landstrider Legion that the two squadrons shall remain neutral with each other, as agreed upon by the leadership of both squadrons. In following with such, we wish peace to all who wish the same, and a high-dose Copium prescription to those who may wish ills or otherwise.
                  <br>Furthermore, while the overall state of the game leaves much to be desired, we believe there is still plenty of fun to be had out in the black. To such ends, I am happy to report that as we have become of requisite size for a Player-Made Faction, our BGS Operations will be underway in the coming days, and more details will be relayed as they are finalized.
                  <br><b>Currently, the Legion asks of all commanders to please:</b>
