            <p>As the squadron continues continues a steady growth, the next steps have been taken by the Order of Imperators to begin the minor faction application process. 
               In preparation for application acceptance, the Landstrider Legion will begin BGS operations in their currently confidential future home system. Members of the server will be provided more information 
               via the Discord and a special section of this website.
            </p>
            <p>All questions regarding BGS operations should be directed to CMDR Sirius T. Dog or any Imperator. <b>IT IS CRUCIAL THAT ALL BGS INFORMATION REMAINS CONFIDENTIAL UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED!</b></p>
            <p>Thank you to all commanders for their continued support. o7</p>
